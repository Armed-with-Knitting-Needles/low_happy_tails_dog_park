        <li>A limit of two (2) dogs per owner/handler in the Dog Park at the same time is permitted. Only one (1) person may be in the entry area with their dog(s) at any time.</li>
        <li>Dogs under six months of age are not permitted in the Dog Park. </li>
        <li>Female dogs in heat are not permitted in the Dog Park. (It is recommended that dogs over 12 months of age should be spayed/neutered.)</li>
        <li>Owners/Handlers may bring water, in plastic bottles only, not glass, into the enclosure of the Dog Park. No other food (human or dog food or dog treats) or beverages are permitted inside the enclosure of the Dog Park.</li>

        <li>Owners/Handlers may bring water, in plastic bottles only, not glass, into the enclosure of the Dog Park. No other food (human or dog food or dog treats) or beverages are permitted inside the enclosure of the Dog Park.</li>
        <li>Use of tobacco products is prohibited in the Dog Park. Nicotine is poisonous to dogs. Cigarette butts must be disposed of safely prior to entering the Dog Park. Cups and bottles should also be disposed of properly as they can also be a
          potential danger to dogs if chewed.</li>
        <li>To ensure a healthy environment for all dogs, they should be free of contagious conditions, including coughing, vomiting and diarrhea, for at least one week prior to visiting the Dog Park.</li>
        <li>NO professional dog training may be done in the Dog Park unless first approved by the LOWA General Manager.</li>
        <li>Dogs must be kept on leash until they are in the designated enclosed off-leash area. All dogs inside the enclosure of the Dog Park must be off-leash. Dogs still on leashes may feel threatened by dogs that are off leash. Owners/handlers
          must
          be inside the enclosure of the Dog Park with their dog(s) at all times with leashes in hand. Remember that some dogs may not get along (for the same reasons some people donâ€™t). Watch your dog carefully to prevent possible problems. NO DOG
          MAY
          BE UNATTENDED.</li>
        <li>IMMEDIATELY PICK UP AND DISPOSE OF DOG WASTE. Plastic bags and trash cans are available. Disease and parasites live in dog waste and can be harmful to other dogs and unpleasant to owners who may accidentally step in it. </li>
        <li>Neither LOWA nor the Happy Tails Dog Club shall be held responsible for any injuries. Owners/handlers are responsible for injuries and/or property damage caused by dogs under their control. If an injury occurs, Owners/handlers shall
          exchange personal information prior to leaving the Dog Park. Owners/handlers shall report the incident to the General Manager and Happy Tails Dog Club President as soon as possible. (Proof of liability insurance is needed for this reason).
        </li>
        <li>Owners/Handlers are responsible for the behavior of their animals in and around the outside of the Dog Park. Aggressive dogs (defined as dogs posing a threat to human beings or other dogs) are not allowed in or near the park.
          Owners/handlers shall immediately remove from the Dog Park any dogs showing signs of aggression. Dogs that are barking persistently should be removed from the Dog Park.</li>
        <li>Toys brought to the park must be taken home with you. (Toys left behind may be destroyed by the lawn mowers.) RAWHIDE TOYS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</li>
        <li>PARKING at the Dog Park will be next to the fenced area and will be limited. Users of the Dog Park may not use the mail station for overflow parking at any time. You are urged to consider walking from the Small Marina parking lot a short
          distance away on Lakeview Parkway if there is no space next to the fenced area.</li>
        <li>Membership Period runs from May 1 â€“ April 30. All who want to continue as a member will need to renew membership by May 1 every year. </li>
